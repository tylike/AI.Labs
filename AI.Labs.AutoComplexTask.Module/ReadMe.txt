Project Description

This project implements a platform-agnostic Module. UI-independent application
elements can be implemented here (Business Objects, Controllers, etc.). The root project
folder contains the Module.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits ModuleBase.
This class allows you to view and customize Module components:
referenced modules, Controllers and business classes. Additionally, the root folder
contains Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep application
settings specific for the current Module. Difference files can be customized in code
or in the Model Editor.
