Project Description

This project implements an ASP.NET Core Blazor Server application (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/).
The root project folder contains the BlazorApplication.cs file with the class that inherits
BlazorApplication. This class allows you to view and customize application components: referenced modules,
security settings, data connection. Additionally, the root folder contains
Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep settings
specific to the current application. Difference files can be customized in code
or in the Model Editor.
The appsettings.json file contains database connection, logging, and theme settings (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration).
