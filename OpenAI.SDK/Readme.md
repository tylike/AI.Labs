## Sample Usages
The repository contains a sample project named **OpenAI.Playground** that you can refer to for a better understanding of how the library works. However, please exercise caution while experimenting with it, as some of the test methods may result in unintended consequences such as file deletion or fine tuning.  

*!! It is highly recommended that you use a separate account instead of your primary account while using the playground. This is because some test methods may add or delete your files and models, which could potentially cause unwanted issues. !!*

Your API Key comes from here --> https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys   
Your Organization ID comes from here --> https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings

### Without using dependency injection:
```csharp
var openAiService = new OpenAIService(new OpenAiOptions()
{
    ApiKey =  Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY")
});
```
### Using dependency injection:
#### secrets.json: 

```csharp
 "OpenAIServiceOptions": {
    //"ApiKey":"Your api key goes here"
    //,"Organization": "Your Organization Id goes here (optional)"
  },
```
*(How to use [user secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows) ?  
Right click your project name in "solution explorer" then click "Manage User Secret", it is a good way to keep your api keys)*

#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService();
```

**OR**  
Use it like below but do NOT put your API key directly to your source code. 
#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService(settings => { settings.ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"); });
```

After injecting your service you will be able to get it from service provider
```csharp
var openAiService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOpenAIService>();
```

You can set default model(optional):
```csharp
openAiService.SetDefaultModelId(Models.Davinci);
```
## Chat Gpt Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = await openAiService.ChatCompletion.CreateCompletion(new ChatCompletionCreateRequest
{
    Messages = new List<ChatMessage>
    {
        ChatMessage.FromSystem("You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Who won the world series in 2020?"),
        ChatMessage.FromAssistant("The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Where was it played?")
    },
    Model = Models.ChatGpt3_5Turbo,
    MaxTokens = 50//optional
});
if (completionResult.Successful)
{
   Console.WriteLine(completionResult.Choices.First().Message.Content);
}
```
## Function Sample

            .AddParameter("num_days", PropertyDefinition.DefineInteger("The number of days to forecast"))
            .Validate()
            .Build();
        var fn3 = new FunctionDefinitionBuilder("get_current_datetime", "Get the current date and time, e.g. 'Saturday, June 24, 2023 6:14:14 PM'")
            .Build();

        var fn4 = new FunctionDefinitionBuilder("identify_number_sequence", "Get a sequence of numbers present in the user message")

                foreach (var entry in fn.ParseArguments())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"  {entry.Key}: {entry.Value}");
                }
            }
        }

## Notes:
#### This library used to be known as `Betalgo.OpenAI.GPT3`, now it has a new package Id `Betalgo.OpenAI`.

Please note that due to time constraints, I was unable to thoroughly test all of the methods or fully document the library. If you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to report them or submit a pull request - your contributions are always appreciated.

I initially developed this SDK for my personal use and later decided to share it with the community. As I have not maintained any open-source projects before, any assistance or feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you would like to contribute in any way, please feel free to reach out to me with your suggestions.

I will always be using the latest libraries, and future releases will frequently include breaking changes. Please take this into consideration before deciding to use the library. I want to make it clear that I cannot accept any responsibility for any damage caused by using the library. If you feel that this is not suitable for your purposes, you are free to explore alternative libraries or the OpenAI Web-API.

I am incredibly busy. If I forgot your name, please accept my apologies and let me know so I can add it to the list.

## Changelog
### 7.4.2
- Let's start with breaking changes:
    - OpenAI has replaced function calling with tools. We have made the necessary changes to our code. This is not a major change; now you just have a wrapper around your function calling, which is named as "tool". The Playground provides an example. Please take a look to see how you can update your code.  
    This update was completed by @shanepowell. Many thanks to him.
- Now we support the Vision API, which involves passing message contents to the existing chat method. It is quite easy to use, but documentation was not available in the OpenAI API documentation.  
This feature was completed by @belaszalontai. Many thanks to them.

### 7.4.1
- Added support for "Create Speech" thanks to @belaszalontai / @szabe74 
### 7.4.0
- Added support for Dall-e 3, thanks to @belaszalontai and @szabe74
- Added support for GPT-4-Turbo/Vision thanks to @ChaseIngersol
- Models are updated with latest.
### 7.3.1
- **Reverting a breking change which will be also Breaking Changes(only for 7.3.0):**
    - Reverting the usage of `EnsureStatusCode()` which caused the loss of error information. Initially, I thought it would help in implementing HTTP retry tools, but now I believe it is a bad idea for two reasons.
        1. You can't simply retry if the request wasn't successful because it could fail for various reasons. For example, you might have used too many tokens in your request, causing OpenAI to reject the response, or you might have tried to use a nonexistent model. It would be better to use the Error object in your retry rules. All responses are already derived from this base object.
        2. We will lose error response data.
### 7.3.0
- Updated Moderation categories as reported by @dmki.
- **Breaking Changes:**
    - Introduced the use of `EnsureStatusCode()` after making requests.Please adjust your code accordingly for handling failure cases. Thanks to @miroljub1995 for reporting.
    - Previously, we used to override paths in the base domain, but this behavior has now changed. If you were using `abc.com/mypath` as the base domain, we used to ignore `/mypath`. This will no longer be the case, and the code will now respect `/mypath`. Thanks to @Hzw576816 for reporting.
### 7.2.0
- Added Chatgpt Finetununig support thanks to @aghimir3 
- Default Azure Openai version increased thanks to @mac8005
- Fixed Azure Openai Audio endpoint thanks to @mac8005
