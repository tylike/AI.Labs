Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure that we maintain a high level of quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

* Use the dev branch as your target branch when creating pull requests.
* For each feature or change you want to contribute, create a separate pull request. Avoid creating large pull requests with lots of changes. Instead, try to contribute with small, focused pieces that are easier to review and merge.
* Before starting work on a new feature or change, consider creating a discussion to see if anyone else is already working on it. This can help prevent duplicated effort and ensure that everyone is working together effectively.

We appreciate your time and effort in contributing to our project. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
