Folder Description

The "api/Localization/" endpoints are intended to obtain localized UI strings through HTTP requests to a Web API service. 
You can use the localized UI strings in your custom application that uses the XAF Web API as a backend.
These additional benefits of our Web API Service ship as part of the DevExpress Universal Subscription (https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
