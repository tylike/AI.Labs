Folder Description

The "api/Report/" endpoints are intended to download PDF, RTF, etc. from report templates (ReportDatav2) based on filtered data in databases. 
Each ReportDatav2 container is stored in your database and links to an XtraReport, and report data sources, and data models that you designed in Visual Studio. 
You can pass a report container identifier, data source criteria, export format, and other parameters to your endpoints.
These additional benefits of our Web API Service ship as part of the DevExpress Universal Subscription (https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
